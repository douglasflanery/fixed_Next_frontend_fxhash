In order to use the features of **fxhash**, you will need to have a tezos wallet. You can find a [list of wallets on the tezos website](https://tezos.com/learn/store-and-use/).

We recommend [Temple](https://templewallet.com/) (browser extension) or [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/) (website).

Once you have a wallet and a tezos account on it, you can synchronize your wallet with fxhash by clicking on the *sync* button.


# Be careful with your tezos
