 * A Contract Operation defines a set of operations to run at different
 * moments of the lifecycle of an operation. When an operation needs to be sent,
 * its corresponding class is instanciated with the operation parameters and
 * the following steps are performed:
 * - prepare: preparation steps before calling a contract
 * - call: the actual contract call
 * - success: a message is emitted
 * In case of failure, the whole lifecycle restarts, if the RPC is at cause it
 * is swapped with another one. This logic is handled by an external runner.
