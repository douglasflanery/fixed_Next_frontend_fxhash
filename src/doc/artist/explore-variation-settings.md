As the artist, we want you to have control over the freedom viewers will have when exploring variations of your project on the token page. Under the display frame, a `variations` button can be used to explore different variations, if enabled when you minted the Generative Token.

You can configure the following settings, for both **during the mint** period and **after fully minted**:

* **enabled**:  is the `variations` button enabled ? if disabled, the button won't be clickable and will appear as disabled
* **number of variations:**
  - **infinite**: viewers can explore any amount of variations and so randomly
  - **limited set of hashes**: define a list of hashes the viewers will cycle through when clicking on the button

These settings should give enough control to define a strategy during the lifetime of your token. You can for instance disabled infinite exploration after token is minted, so that the front end only display a finite number of states through the minted collection of the token. You decide.

*Please note that this has no effect on the iterations which will be generated from your project.*
